# Global-Energy-Consumption-Emissions-Analysis-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP, population, and per-capita metrics using SQL for data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (data cleaning, transformation, analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard creation and insights)

## Files in Repository
- `Energy_Consumption_Analysis.sql` – SQL queries for data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis  
- `Energy_Consumption_Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations

## Key Analysis
- Country-wise energy consumption and production trends  
- Emissions vs GDP and population comparison  
- Per-capita energy consumption and emissions analysis  
- Year-wise trend analysis

## Dashboard Highlights
- KPI cards for total consumption, emissions, and production  
- Line charts for yearly trends  
- Bar charts for top/bottom countries  
- Maps and comparative visuals for country-level insights

## How to Use
1. Run the SQL script on the dataset to generate cleaned/aggregated tables  
2. Open the Power BI `.pbix` file  
3. Refresh data (if connected to your SQL source)  
4. Explore insights using filters and slicers

## Outcome
The project helps identify energy usage patterns, high-emission countries, and the relationship between energy consumption, economy, and population.
